# Math Tricks

Brief instructions and description for the game "Math Tricks":

Every time the game starts, the main menu is displayed. There, the player has the option to either start a new game or continue a previous game (only if a previous unfinished game exists). If the player chooses to continue an old game, it will load in the console. However, if the player opts to start a new game, they will need to choose the desired board size (the size must be at least 4x4). Once the program successfully receives the dimensions, the board is generated, and the game begins.

Moves are easy to make. To move, the player has to (who is currently playing) enter the coordinates of the cell (in X and Y) they wish to move to (left, right, up, down, or diagonally). The coordinates on the top and left of the board are used for easier coordination. After each successful move, the game saves automatically. The game board contains cells with mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—as well as a special "0" cell. The new score is calculated based on the mathematical operation and the number on the newly selected cell on the board (the player cannot have a negative score, after each move, each player’s points will either be zero or more). The special "0" cell resets the player's score to zero when they step on it.

The game ends when a player is "trapped" between occupied cells and has no valid moves left, or when all the cells on the board have been visited. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.
